# SoulWorker Damage chart

To answer the eternal question, Should i increase my AB or BD ?
<br/>
[Damage Chart](https://mush-0.github.io/sw-dmg-chart/) is an online chart drawing tool that shows the damage dealt values with changing AB and BD values, so you can decide the answer yourself.

# How to use it

You enter the character stats values, specify the AB/BD range and finally choose the boss you are fighting.
Then click "**Draw Chart**" button.
<br>
I put a real character values as a place holders in the input fields as a starter guide.
You can find more information on formulas and special notes in the site.

# Other tools

I made another tool [VS Material Calculator](https://mush-0.github.io/VS-Calc/) to calculate how many materials you need to craft violent sun raid items.
